Have you ever wondered what happens to your resume after you hit "Submit" on a job board? **Resume Matcher** pulls back the curtain. 

This full-stack application uses cutting-edge AI (powered by **SambaNova Cloud**) to act as an expert ATS (Applicant Tracking System) and career coach. It analyzes a resume against a job description, scores the match, identifies missing skills, and provides actionable advice.

## 🏗️ How It Works (Architecture)

The platform is designed to be blazing fast and scalable, utilizing a modern split-stack architecture.

## 💻 Local Development Setup

Want to run it on your own machine? It's easy! You'll need Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, and a [SambaNova Cloud API key](https://cloud.sambanova.ai/).

### 1. The Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the Python magic
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup your environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and add your SAMBANOVA_API_KEY!

# Fire it up!
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
*Your API is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. You can view the automated Swagger docs at `/docs`.*

### 2. The Frontend (React/Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Start the blazing-fast Vite dev server
npm run dev
```
*Your beautiful UI is now running at `http://localhost:5173`.*

## 🚀 One-Click Production Deployment (Render)

We've automated the entire deployment process using **Render Blueprints**. With a single configuration file (`render.yaml`), Render knows exactly how to build and host both the FastAPI backend and the React frontend simultaneously.

![Render Deployment Process](https://render.com/images/render-logo-wordmark.svg)

### Deploying the Complete Stack

1. Create a free account on [Render](https://render.com).
2. Go to your Dashboard and click **New +** → **Blueprint**.
3. Connect your GitHub repository containing this code.
4. Render will automatically read the `render.yaml` file and prepare two distinct services:
   *   `resume-matcher-backend` (A deployed Docker web service)
   *   `resume-matcher-frontend` (A lightning-fast global Static Site)
5. **Configure your Environment Variables:**

   **For the Backend (`resume-matcher-backend`):**
   *   `SAMBANOVA_API_KEY`: Your secret SambaNova Cloud API key.
   *   *(Optional)* `ENDEE_URL`: If you are using an external Vector Database. Leave dummy text if not.

   **For the Frontend (`resume-matcher-frontend`):**
   *   `VITE_API_URL`: The URL of your newly created backend (e.g., `https://resume-matcher-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`). *Note: Render creates the backend first, so you copy the URL and paste it here!*

6. Click **Apply**. 

🎉 That's it! Render will automatically pull the Docker image, assign dynamic ports (`$PORT`), build the static site, and wire everything together. Your intelligent Resume Matcher is live on the internet!
